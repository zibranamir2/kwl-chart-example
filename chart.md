# KWL Chart

Zibran Amir's KWL Chart

| Topic | Know | Want to Know | Learned |
| ------| ------- | ------ | ------- |
| Git | I honestly never heard of Git before taking this class, except for 'GitHub'. | So what exactly is Git? Why is it useful for CS? | _ |
| GitHub | I see it as a hosting site where programmers post their codes and projects, sort of like a SoundCloud for CS. | Why is GitHub so essential to CS? |
| Terminal | From C++ and python, I knew it as a place where you run command lines and execute your codes. |  | _ |
| IDE | It's a space where you actually write all the codes for a project/software. | _ | _ |
| text editors | A software where you simply "edit texts". | _ | _ |
|file system | The place in the computer where files are stored. | _ |_ |
|bash | I never heard of this term before this class. | _ | _ |
|abstraction | (one of the hardest concept to learn in CS as it is very complicated) Something to do with removal of physical space in CS? | _ | _ |
|programming languages | Different platforms with their own set of rules and features that are used for coders to develop something. Eg. python, C++, HTML, MATLAB, etc. | _ | _ |
|git workflows | Since I have heard of Git, I never heard of git workflows either, honestly. | _ | _ |
| git branches | I don't know anything about git branches either. | _ | _ |
| bash redirects | I never heard of bashes, let alone bash redirects before. | _ | _ |
|number systems | I am guessing how numbers can be classified by prog. languages as being "integer" or "float". | _ | _ |
| merge conflicts | A very common thing I see written when my code is not working while running it, but never knew what that really is. | _ | _ |
| documentation | A place where all the features of a particular programming language are recorded, so that a user can have easy access to know what they can use in their code. | _ | _ |
| templating | When you take out a template code and then modify it to make your own program. | _ | _ |
|bash scripting | I don't know what bash is, let alone "bash scripting". | _ | _ |
| developer tools | Any software or site for developing a program or software. Github is an example of it. | _ | _ |
| networking | Where you connect your computer to another computer to share data and code, and collaborate on a project. | _ | _ |
|ssh | I don't know what they are. | _ | _ |
| ssh keys | I don't know what they are. | _ | _ |
|compiling | When a particular code (written in high level language) is converted into a machine-level code, so that the computer can read them. | _ | _ |
| linking   | Combining various parts of codes into a single one. | _ | _ |
| building | Writing a code? | _ | _ |
| machine representation  | How computeres "represent" numbers? | _ | _ |
| integers   | Numbers that are not decimals. (eg. 1, 2, 44, 1000, etc) Like 4.3 is not an integer. | _ | _ |
| floating point  | When numbers are expressed in scientific notations. | _ | _ |
|logic gates | The fundamental block of digital circuit, where there is a binary state (only two) that is either AND or OR (0 or 1). | _ | _ |
| ALU | I am not so sure what ALUs are. | _ | _ |
| binary operations | Arithmetic (+, -, %, X), but with binary numbers. | _ | _ |
| memory | The place inside the computer, where the data is stored. | _ | _ |
| cache | The place inside the computer, where the data is stored in a way, that future requests for that data is served faster. (eg. how passwords are stored in browsers). | _ | _ |
| register | I am not exactly sure what registers are in computers, but I have definitely heard of them. | _ | _ |
| clock | A clock inside the computer (I think a microchip) that regulates the timing of a computer process. | _ | _ |
| Concurrency | I don't know what that is. | _ | _ |
